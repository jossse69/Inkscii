# Inkscii

An ASCII game framework that utilizes SFML for rendering. 

## Description

Inkscii is an ASCII game framework designed to simplify the development of ASCII-based games. It provides a rendering engine that utilizes SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for displaying ASCII characters on the screen. The framework offers functionalities for drawing characters, printing text, handling user input, and more.

## Features

- Rendering ASCII characters and text using SFML.
- Support for custom character and background colors.
- Input handling for keyboard events.
- Basic game loop structure.

## Requirements

- SFML: Inkscii depends on SFML for rendering and input handling. Make sure you have SFML installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/jossse69/Inkscii.git`
2. Build the project using your preferred development environment or build system. Make sure to link against SFML.

3. Customize the framework to suit your game's needs by modifying the provided classes such as `Renderer`, `InputHandler`, and `Program`.

4. Create your ASCII game by implementing game logic within the main loop of `Program.cs`.

5. Run the compiled executable and enjoy your ASCII game!
